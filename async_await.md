## Books
* [**Concurrency in C# Cookbook**](http://stephencleary.com/book/) - Stephen Cleary's book on Concurrency. Jon Skeet says: "*The ideal reference book for modern .NET concurrency*" and if it's good enough for Jon, it's good enough for me!

* [**Threading in C#**](http://www.albahari.com/threading/) - Joseph Albahari has a free ebook on his site, which goes into lots of awesome details on threading
